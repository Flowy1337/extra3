Great series so far!
I just recently started following your tutorial, 
lthough I must say it is not totally a beginner friendly series like you've explained,
but I am also watching another Unity beginner series from Brackeys so I can be familiar in using Unity as a beginner whilst working side by side with your V.N tutorial!
Thank you so much for this you and your videos are of great help for me
